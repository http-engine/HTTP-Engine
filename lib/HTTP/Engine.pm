=head1 NAME

HTTP::Engine - Web Server Gateway Interface and HTTP Server Engine Drivers (Yet Another Catalyst::Engine)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use HTTP::Engine;
  my $engine = HTTP::Engine->new(
      interface => {
          module => 'ServerSimple',
          args   => {
              host => 'localhost',
              port =>  1978,
          },
          request_handler => 'main::handle_request',# or CODE ref
      },
  );
  $engine->run;

  use Data::Dumper;
  sub handle_request {
      my $req = shift;
      HTTP::Engine::Response->new( body => Dumper($req) );
  }


=head1 MILESTONE

=head2 0.02xxx (Now here)

A substantial document. (A tutorial, the Cookbook and hacking HowTo)
The specification is changed by the situation.

We want to perform Async support. (AnyEvent? Danga::Socket? IO::Async? use Coro?)

=head2 0.1.x

Improvement in performance and resource efficiency.
Most specifications are frozen.
The specification is changed by the situation.

=head3 0.1.4

switched to L<Any::Moose>

=head2 0.0.99_x

It is an adjustment stage to the following version.

=head2 0.0.x

Version 0.0.x is a concept release, the internal interface is still fluid. 
It is mostly based on the code of Catalyst::Engine.

=head1 COMPATIBILITY

version over 0.0.13 is incompatible of version under 0.0.12.

using L<HTTP::Engine::Compat> module if you want compatibility of version under 0.0.12.

version 0.0.13 is unsupported of context and middleware.

=head1 MIDDLEWARE

Middleware can be used if you wish. Please see L<HTTP::Engine::Middleware>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

HTTP::Engine abstracts handling the input and output of various web server
environments, including CGI, mod_perl and FastCGI. 

While some people use <CGI.pm>  in a CGI environment, but switch
<Apache::Request> under mod_perl for better performance, these HTTP request
abstractions have incompatible interfaces, so it is not easy to switch between
them.

HTTP::Engine will prepare a L<HTTP::Engine::Request> object for you which is
optimized for your current environment, and pass that to your request handler.
Your request handler than prepares a L<HTTP::Engine::Response> object, which we
communicate back to the server for you. 

L<HTTP::Engine::Request> covers the bases of common request process tasks, like
handling GET and POST parameters and processing file uploads. Unlike CGI.pm,
but like most other web programming languages, it allows you to mix GET and
POST parameters.

And importantly, it allows you to seamlessly move your code from CGI to a
persistent without rewriting your code. At the same time, you'll maintain the
possibility of additional performance benefits, as HTTP::Engine can
transparently take advantage of native mod_perl functions when they are
available.

=head1 INTERFACES

Interfaces are the actual environment-dependent components which handles
the actual interaction between your clients and the application.

For example, in CGI mode, you can write to STDOUT and expect your clients to
see it, but in mod_perl, you may need to use $r-E<gt>print instead.

Interfaces are the actual layers that does the interaction. HTTP::Engine
currently supports the following:

Interfaces can be specified as part of the HTTP::Engine constructor:

  my $interface = HTTP::Engine::Interface::FastCGI->new(
    request_handler => ...
  );
  HTTP::Engine->new(
    interface => $interface
  )->run();

Or you can let HTTP::Engine instantiate the interface for you:

  HTTP::Engine->new(
    interface => {
      module => 'FastCGI',
      args   => {
      }
      request_handler => ...
    }
  )->run();
