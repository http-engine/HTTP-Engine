=head1 NAME

HTTP::Engine::Role::Interface - The Interface Role Definition

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package HTTP::Engine::Interface::CGI;
  use Any::Moose;
  with 'HTTP::Engine::Role::Interface';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

HTTP::Engine::Role::Interface defines the role of an interface in HTTP::Engine.

Specifically, an Interface in HTTP::Engine needs to do at least two things:

=over 4

=item Create a HTTP::Engine::Request object from the client request

If you are on a CGI environment, you need to receive all the data from 
%ENV and such. If you are running on a mod_perl process, you need to muck
with $r. 

In any case, you need to construct a valid HTTP::Engine::Request object
so the application handler can do the real work.

=item Accept a HTTP::Engine::Response object, send it back to the client

The application handler must return an HTTP::Engine::Response object.

In turn, the interface needs to do whatever necessary to present this
object to the client. In a  CGI environment, you would write to STDOUT.
In mod_perl, you need to call the appropriate $r->headers methods and/or
$r->print
